Chapter 2 : Maven

2.1)
It helps programmers manage their projects and all the things they need to build their programs.

Maven manages Transitive Dependency: It's like a tree structure of dependencies from top to bottom. And maven manages to handle them pretty efficiently.

Maven uses target directory. It puts all its stuff that it's process. Either jar files, docs and classes etc.

2.2) Commands:

a) mvnw [options] [<goal(s)>] [<phase(s)>]

    - Maven has three phases
    i)   clean   - Remove temporary directories and file

    There is also pre-clean and post-clean
    - pre-clean  - Hook for before cleaning.
    - post-clean - Hook for actual cleaning.

    ii)  default - Where the most usefull goals live. Mostly do building and testing and all good stuff.
    iii) site    - All the docs are generated like reports, java docs etc.


b) mvnw clean
   - Cleans the target directory

c) mvnw [default]
        - compile : Compiles your code into bytecode.
        - test    : Runs unit tests.                  (first executes compile then test)
        - package : Creates a jar or war file.        (first executes compile then test and finally package)
        - verify  : Runs cheks and integration tests. (first executes compile then test, then package and finally verify)
