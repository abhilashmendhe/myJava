Chapter 3 : Spring framework vs. Spring Boot

3.2) Spring boot or framework can be thought as n - layers. These layers consist of Presentation, Service and Persistence layer. The application is typically broken into these layers.

a) Persistence layer  :
    This layer is use to handle interactions with databases. We often consider entities which are java objects often mapped the domain to databases tables.
    We typically use entities at this level to interact with database by using different patterns. These patterns are Repositories patterns and DAO(Data Access Objects) patterns.
    Type of functionalities are CRUD, exposed by Repositories or DAO patterns. We can build our own functions in repositories or DAO patterns.

b) Service layer      :
    This layer uses all the functionalities exposed by Persistence layer and then use it to build the requirements that our applications are built to handle.
    We typically do this by setting interfaces and classes. These are services.

c) Presentation layer :
    The goal of this layer is to take all the data from services layer and then expose this to user by using REST API, or GraphQL api or WebSocket api.
    To use different API, we only need make changes in Presentation layer.
