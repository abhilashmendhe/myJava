Chapter 6 : Databases

6.1) Database Layers
    a) Database Driver (bottom - 1st layer)
        This allows to interact with database from your JAVA code.
    b) (2nd layer)
        i) JDBC
            We consider this as a low level API, you interact with database using SQL queries.
        ii) Spring JDBC
            It is built on the top of JDBC. It makes little easier to interact with database than JDBC.
    c) (3rd layer)
        i) JPA (Java Persistence API)
            It allows to interact with databases using JAVA objects. JPA built on top of JDBC. It's a high level API. Here we can swap the database we are using or persistence technology we are using and we don't have
            to change a lot of code. Everything(querks) is handled by JPA.
            JPA is just a specification. Actual implementaion is Hibernate (ORM).
        ii) Spring Data JPA
            It is built on top of JPA.

6.2) Connect to in-memory H2 Database
    Add configuration to application.properties file
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
    spring.datasrouce.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
    spring.datasource.username=sa
    spring.datasource.password=password

    Even if the properties are not given, the spring automatically creates a URL by using beans
